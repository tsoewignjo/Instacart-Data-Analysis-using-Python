# Instacart Data Analysis using Python

## Introduction
This is a data analysis project using Python. <br> <br>
Modules used:
- import pandas as pd
- import numpy as np
- import os
- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
- import seaborn as sns
- import scipy

## Objective
Instacart is an **online grocery store** that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Context
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database
along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the
same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target
different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect
on the sale of their products. The analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to
ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products. 

## Key Questions
- What are the busiest days of the week and hours of  day?
- Are there particular times of the day when people spend the most money?
- Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others?
- What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
- Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
- What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
- What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles?
